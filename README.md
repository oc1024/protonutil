# ProtonUtil
Script that helps using Proton prefixes on a PoL-like level.
!! ALPHA !!

# Goal
Create something akin to the PlayOnLinux config tools for Proton.

Some games, like Resident Evil 5 and L. A. Noire, are known to work well on Wine once some Winetricks are applied. PlayOnLinux has a GUI for applying these changes, but Proton doesn't. This project tries to fill that niche.

# Features

* Pre-setting environment variables: No constant updating of Wine configurations.
* Detects and names compatdata according to AppIds automatically
* Detects Proton versions
* Built-in Winetricks support
* 32-bit support hacks for Proton and games.

# Installation

Clone this repo and make protutil.py executable.
